A CoB LED simulation project for the thermal investigation of the phosphor. The simulation requires about 20 GB RAM and 8 GB HDD space because of the high number of rays. The simulation produces temperature, voltage and optical distribution results. (The output side is output_side=OUT, in this case the lum files also cantain radiance data, not luminance.)
