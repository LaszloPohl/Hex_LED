# Hex_LED
Hex simulator extended with LED capabilities
This simulator was used e.g in the following publication:
https://doi.org/10.1109%2FTHERMINIC.2019.8923856

This simulator was originally designed for internal use and is not user friendly. It doesnâ€™t currently have documentation, so you need a lot of entrepreneurial spirit to explore it. We plan to supplement the project with basic documentation. If you want to use the simulator or the source code, you have to discover for yourself, because we do not currently have the capacity to provide support or help.

The originally uploaded version includes some simulation parameters built into the source code (initialization current, number of LEDs connected in series, etc.), which will be exposed in the model description files. The originally uploaded model files match the original program, and they will be updated when I update the source code, if I don't forget.

It was not originally planned to publish the source code, so its documentation is not optimal either. Many names and comments are in Hungarian. The source code contains a number of sections that are waiting to be added in the future. Most of these will probably not be completed because a new simulator will be made.

Hex 2 is under construction, which will have a user-friendly interface and source code (planned release around 2025).
